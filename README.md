Javascript 2021 Mastery Udemy course

This is an udemy course project taught by Jonas Schmedtmann (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to advance in Javascript.

The main concepts utilized in this project are:

1. The MVC pattern JS implementation (using the JS classes, private & protected fields, inheritence, methods etc.)
2. The async fetching (handling async code with await/async, handling success and error) 
3. Event publisher/subscriber pattern (to allow event handling in the controller and the views)
4. Configuration and helper functions files in the project structure 
5. Parcel to run and build the app
